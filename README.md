## VANDYHACKS VI - ART

This was originally a project I took on at Vandyhacks VI for their art theme. Given that we're in a pandemic and I've got some extra time (lol), I've returned.

I'm looking to try to get this controlled for Python version, but with Python 3.8.3 and the pygame version listed in the `requirements.txt` file, this (mostly) works. For a demo, I'd recommend using the IDE to open `demoInput.txt` and running that.
